# BC-DenialBar

To use the BOT in this repository:
1) Log into BC with the character that you will use as a BOT
2) Create a room in "private" state so that you can work without anyone entering too soon.
3) Select the name/description/background of the room
4) Open the command line (F15 or Ctrl + Shift +K)
WARNING: copy-pasting code into the command line can be dangrous, you should only copy-paste code that you can understand and that come from a trusted source.
5) Copy the content of the .js file that you want to use into the command window and press ENTER. 
6) Enjoy
